## About Me

My name is Stathis Vafeias, and I work for a biometric authentication startup called [AimBrain](https://www.aimbrain.com).
I received my PhD in Robotics from Edinburgh University under the supervision of S.Ramamoorthy. My research interest is 
learning how to perceive the world.

## This Blog

In this blog I'll publish bits and pieces from projects I've been working on. My goal is to share
some of the things I've learned and provide an easy step-by-step documentation to my projects.
