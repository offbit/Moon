## About Me

My name is Stathis Vafeias and I'm a ML hacker! I received my PhD in Robotics from Edinburgh University under the supervision of S.Ramamoorthy. My research is focused on learning how to perceive the world. Currently I work for a London based start-up, [AimBrain](https://www.aimbrain.com) where I lead the efforts of creating machine learning algorithms for a biometric authentication platform.

## This Blog

In this blog I'll publish bits and pieces from projects I've been working on. My goal is to share
some of the things I've learned and provide an easy step-by-step documentation to my projects.
